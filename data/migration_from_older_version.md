Migration From Older Versions 
==============

## 4.x -> 4.3

Since v.4.3, these extensions - [Week Agenda View](weekagenda_view.md), [Grid View](grid_view.html), [Timeline View](timeline_view.md), [Units View](units_view.md), [Multisection Events](api/scheduler_multisection_config.md) - are not longer available in the Standard Edition that is distributed under GNU GPL v2.

If you still want to use them, you may either continue using the version 4.2 (or older) or obtain Commercial or Enterprise license.

Please check the license details [here](http://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxScheduler/#licenses).

## 3.6 -> 4.0

Public API - fully backward compatible


### Changed defaults

Default skin changed to "terrace", ext/dhtmlxscheduler_dhx_terrace.js is removed.  
To change skin back to classic one, just include the related css file (codebase/dhtmlxscheduler_classic.css) For more details check skins.md

api/scheduler_multi_day_config.md is enabled by default,and  if you want to revert such behavior, add:
~~~js
scheduler.config.multi_day = false;
~~~


### Custom skins
Scheduler detects the used skin, based on name of css file, so if you are using custom skin ( which is not based on "terrace" ), rename its css file to dhtmlxscheduler_{skin name}.css. 
Also, you can disable the skin auto-detection by adding the next line before scheduler.init

scheduler.skin = "{skin name}";



### Deprecated API

The next API is deprecated: getEventText, getEventStartDate, getEventEndDate, setEventText, setEventStartDate, setEventEndDate  
( those methods are still available, but will be removed in Scheduler 5.x )


Instead, you can use scheduler.getEvent() and set|get properties directly from event object




## 3.6 -> 3.7

Fully backward compatible

## 3.5 -> 3.6

Fully backward compatible

## 3.0 -> 3.5

Public API - fully backward compatible 
  
  



+ 'Mark now' functionality was moved to the dhtmlxscheduler_limit.js extension. 
+ Scheduler now accepts [JSON generated by dhtmlxConnector](server_integration.md#retrievingdatainjsonformat). 
If there are no special reasons to use XML, consider switching to JSON (will decrease file size and, as a result, increase load speed).

## 2.3 -> 3.0

Public API - fully backward compatible 
  
  
For private API - check  [Scheduler 3.0](scheduler_3.0.md)



+ File structure was changed a bit - ext/dhtmlxscheduler_ext.css and dhtmlxscheduler_recurring.css were removed (all styles now available in the dhtmlxscheduler.css)
+ Several templates arguments were changed to match the rest of them - scheduler.templates.agenda_text, scheduler.templates.map_text now use (start_date, end_date, event) as incoming parameters. Before only 'event' was used.

## 2.2 -> 2.3


+ full backward compatibility
+ Swedish locale file was renamed according to the iso 639-1
~~~
     sources/locale_se.js => sources/locale_sv.js
     sources/locale_recurring_se.js => sources/locale_recurring_sv.js
~~~

## 2.1 -> 2.2


+ full backward compatibility
+ 'createUnitsView' command accepts different set of parameters, but previous syntax will work as well


## 2.0 -> 2.1 


+ formatting rules were corrected, now %d and %m always return 2 digits, if you need the previous behavior, use %j and %n accordingly

     codebase/dhtmlxgrid_recurring.css=> codebase/ext/dhtmlxgrid_recurring.css
     codebase/dhtmlxgrid_units.js => codebase/ext/dhtmlxgrid_units.js

+ 'onEventChanged' and 'onEventAdded' events will not fire during data loading
+ Spanish locale renamed from locale_sp.js to locale_es.js
+ 'drag_create' option now controls only the ability to create a new event by dnd, creating a new event by dblclick now is controlled by 'dblclick_create'
