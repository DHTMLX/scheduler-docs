dhtmlxScheduler with PHP 
=====================

In this tutorial you will find necessary information on how to create a Scheduler using PHP and REST API on the server side.

There are tutorials intended for building server-side integration with the help of other platforms:

- howtostart_nodejs.md
- howtostart_dotnet.md
- howtostart_ruby.md

It seems obvious that while developing an application with PHP, one will use a ready framework instead of creating everything from scratch.
