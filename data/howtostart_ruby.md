dhtmlxScheduler with Ruby on Rails 
=========================

In this article we'll show you how to create a Scheduler and implement server-side integration based on [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) framework and REST API.

If you use some other technology, check the list of available integration variants below:

- howtostart_php.md
- howtostart_nodejs.md
- howtostart_dotnet.md


If you have Ruby on Rails installed, you can begin to implement the integration at once. 
Otherwise, you should install the framework by following the steps described in the [installation guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#installing-rails).

Once everything is ready, we can start completing the integration step by step.

Step 1. Creating a Project
-----------------------------

To add a new project just run the following command in the terminal:

~~~js
rails new path/to/your/project
~~~

Step 2. Creating a Controller 
------------------------------------------

Now we need to add a controller that will process users' request to the server through the application.
Since requests differ in their type, we need separate controllers for certain requests.

To define the connection between a controller and the type of request, we will use routing. Different routes can be served by different actions.
The actions collect information which will be passed to the view.

Letâ€™s create a new controller with the name "home" and a new action called "index".

~~~js
cd path/to/your/project
rails generate controller home index
~~~

The output should confirm that new files were created.

Step 3. Specifying Routing
-----------------------------

To configure the routing, open the file *config/routes.rb*. Find the following line at the very beginning of this file:

~~~js
get 'home/index'
~~~

and replace it with the following one:

~~~js
root :to => 'home#index'
get "data", :to=>"event#get", :as=>"data"
post "data(/:id)", :to => "event#add"
put "data/:id", :to => "event#update"
delete "data/:id", :to => "event#delete"
~~~

After that we can test our server by running in the command line: 

~~~js
rails server
~~~

Open *http://localhost:3000/* in your browser. The result should be like this:

So the server is ready and we can proceed with views adding.

Step 4. Including Source Files
-------------------------------

To begin with, we should [download the dhtmlxScheduler package](https://dhtmlx.com/docs/products/dhtmlxScheduler/download.shtml). 

Complete the next steps:

1) Unpack the file *codebase/dhtmlxscheduler.js* and the directories *codebase/ext* and *codebase/locale* 
from the package to the directory *vendor/assets/javascripts/* of your project

You should get something like following:

<img src="ruby_unpack_js.png">

2) Unpack the files 

- *codebase/dhtmlxscheduler.css*
- *codebase/dhtmlxscheduler_classic.css*
- *codebase/dhtmlxscheduler_flat.css* 
- *codebase/dhtmlxscheduler_glossy.css* 

from the package to the directory *vendor/assets/stylesheets/* of your project.

You should get something like following:

<img src="ruby_unpack_styles.png">

3) In the "public" directory create the "assets" folder and unpack the following files into it:

- *codebase/imgs*
- *codebase/imgs_dhx_terrace*
- *codebase/imgs_flat*
- *codebase/imgs_glossy*

You should get something like following:

<img src="ruby_unpack_assets.png">

4) Open the **config/initializers/assets.rb** file and add *dhtmlxscheduler.js* and *dhtmlxscheduler.css* files to the precompile array. 
For this purpose, use the code below:

~~~js
Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( dhtmlxscheduler.css )
Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w( dhtmlxscheduler.js )
~~~

Step 5. Creating Views
------------------------

Now we are ready to create a view. Views will visualize the information gathered by actions. 

If there's no controller-specific layout, Rails will use the *app/views/layouts/application.html.erb* file
as a template for all pages that have common elements. We should add scheduler js and css files here, so add following strings to header:

~~~html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>SchedulerRubyRest</title>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'application',media:'all','data-turbolinks-track'=>true %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'dhtmlxscheduler',media:'all','data-turbolinks-track'=>true %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'dhtmlxscheduler', 'data-turbolinks-track' => true %>
  <%= csrf_meta_tags %>
</head>
<body>

<%= yield %>

</body>
</html>
~~~

At this point we can specify a view for the "home" controller that we've created at the [Step 2](howtostart_ruby.md#step2creatingacontroller). 
For this, open the file *app/views/home/index.html.erb*. We need to add a container for the future scheduler and initialize the Scheduler, like this:

~~~html
<div id="scheduler_here" class="dhx_cal_container" style='width:100%; height:800px;'>
	<div class="dhx_cal_navline">
    	<div class="dhx_cal_prev_button">&nbsp;</div>
    	<div class="dhx_cal_next_button">&nbsp;</div>
    	<div class="dhx_cal_today_button"></div>
    	<div class="dhx_cal_date"></div>
    	<div class="dhx_cal_tab" name="day_tab" style="right:204px;"></div>
    	<div class="dhx_cal_tab" name="week_tab" style="right:140px;"></div>
    	<div class="dhx_cal_tab" name="month_tab" style="right:76px;"></div>
  	</div>
  	<div class="dhx_cal_header">
  	</div>
  	<div class="dhx_cal_data">
  	</div>
</div>

<script>	
    scheduler.init("scheduler_here", new Date(2016,4,27), "week");
</script>
~~~

After that we can have a look at the current result. Open *http://localhost:3000/* (the rails server) in a browser.
You will see an empty scheduler:

<img src="ruby_empty_scheduler.png">

Thus you've got a scheduler where you can add events and modify them. But it lacks the saving ability. 

To provide it, we need to proceed with creating models.

Step 6. Creating Models
----------------------

Since Scheduler operates events entities, we need to add a model for them.

To create a model for events, we need to run the following command that contains the event's properties:

~~~js
rails generate model Event start_date:datetime end_date:datetime text:string
~~~

You can find the list of mandatory properties of the Event object with their descriptions 
in the [corresponding article](loading_data.md#dataproperties) of documentation.


After that we can create a new database:

~~~js
rake db:migrate
~~~

Now you can try to add an entry into it. The algorithm is the following:

1 . Open the Rails console by running:

~~~js
rails c
~~~

2 . Add the desired events like this:

~~~js
Event.create 
	:start_date => "2016-05-27 10:00:00", 
    :end_date => "2016-05-27 15:00:00", 
	:text => "Test";
~~~


3 . To display all events, run the command:

~~~js
Event.all
~~~

4 . Enter "exit" to close the console.

<img src="ruby_console.png">

Next we need to implement data loading and saving in the scheduler with the help of controllers.


Step 7. Creating Event Controller
--------------------

###General technique of loading data using REST API

There's a [common technique](server_integration.md#technique) for loading data into Scheduler from the server side.

You will find the requirements to the client side, as well as the [description of possible requests and responses](server_integration.md#requestresponsedetails) 
in the server_integration.md article.

Below we will consider how to load data into Scheduler using Ruby on Rails server side.

###Event Controller

To create a new controller event, run the following command:

~~~js
rails generate controller event
~~~

We will add the code that will enable data adding, changing and deleting into the file of this event - *app/controllers/event_controller.rb*:

~~~js
class EventController < ApplicationController
	protect_from_forgery

	def get
		 events = Event.all

		render :json => events.map {|event| {
			:id => event.id,
            :start_date => event.start_date.to_formatted_s(:db),
            :end_date => event.end_date.to_formatted_s(:db),
            :text => event.text
        }}		
	end
	
	def add
		event = Event.create 
        	:text=>params["text"], 
            :start_date=>params["start_date"], 
            :end_date=>params["end_date"]
            
		render :json=>{:action => "inserted", :tid => event.id}
	end
	
	def update
		event = Event.find(params["id"])
		event.text = params["text"]
		event.start_date = params["start_date"]
		event.end_date = params["end_date"]
		event.save
		
		render :json=>{:action => "updated"}
	end
	
	def delete
		Event.find(params["id"]).destroy
        
		render :json=>{:action => "deleted"}
	end
end
~~~

The code of Task Controller includes the following types of requests:

- GET request is used to load data into Scheduler

It will make an object with data for a Gantt chart and will contain a list of events. 
The dates of events should be converted into appropriate strings.

- POST request means that a new item needs to be inserted into the database
- PUT request updates an existing record 
- DELETE request goes for deleting

All actions return a JSON response containing the type of the performed operation or "error" if something went wrong.

Note that a response for the "insert" action also contains a database id of the new record. 
It will be applied on the client side, so the new item could be mapped to the database entity. 


Step 8. Initializing Scheduler
--------------------------

The last thing we have to do is to put the following code into the &#60;script&#62;&#60;/script&#62; part of the *app/views/home/index.html.erb* file.

~~~js
scheduler.config.xml_date="%Y-%m-%d %H:%i";
scheduler.init("scheduler_here", new Date(2016,4,27), "week");
scheduler.load("<%= data_path %>/", "json");

var dp = new dataProcessor("<%= data_path %>/");
dp.init(scheduler);
dp.setTransactionMode("REST");
~~~

It initializes Scheduler and enables it to load and save data. That's all. Now we can run our application in a browser and see the result.

<img src="ruby_ready_scheduler.png">

As you can see, an event appeared in the scheduler. We have added it at the [Step 6](howtostart_ruby.md#step6creatingmodels).  
Now you can add more events and modify them. All the changes will be saved in the database.
