Third Party Licenses
===========

This article contains Third Party Software Notices and/or Additional Terms and Conditions for licensed third party software components included within the DHTMLX Scheduler library.

**Roboto Google font** is not compiled with our library by default. Starting from Scheduler v5.0, the Material skin imports Roboto font dynamically from `https://fonts.googleapis.com`. The font is used under the Apache Software License.

The DHTMLX Scheduler library provides you with source less files of Scheduler skin. You can install an NPM package and run the npm-watch script from the *codebase/sources/less/package.json* file to modify and rebuild the existing skins. The **npm-watch** and **less** libraries are used under the MIT and Apache licenses and not included in the scheduler package by default.

Additionally, we use some open source libraries in our samples, for example, **DHTMLX Suite 5.x** and **DHTMLX Suite 6.x**.
You can find **Underscore** and **Backbone** Node.js modules in the samples' package.
The **jQuery** library is included from CDN. 
Such modules of the Node.js library as **Express, body-parser, helmet, etc.,** are used on the backend for running our samples.
